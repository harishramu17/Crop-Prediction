<h1>Crop Prediction:</h1>
The impact of climate change in India, most of the agricultural crops are being badly affected in terms of their performance over a period of the last two decades. Predicting the crop yield in advance of its harvest would help the policy makers and farmers for taking appropriate measures for marketing and storage. This project will help the farmers to know the yield of their crop before cultivating onto the agricultural field and thus help them to make the appropriate decisions. It attempts to solve the issue by building a prototype of an interactive prediction system. Implementation of such a system with an easy-to-use web based graphic user interface and the machine learning algorithm will be carried out. The results of the prediction will be made available to the farmer. Thus, for such kind of data analytics in crop prediction, there are different techniques or algorithms, and with the help of those algorithms we can predict crop yield. Random forest algorithm is used. By analysing all these issues and problems like weather, temperature, humidity, rainfall, moisture, there is no proper solution and technologies to overcome the situation faced by the farmers.
